## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Apps that I tend to use are and features I enjoy:

1. Apple News:
   
Stay up to date on latest news regarding my own interests.

Finding new recipes that pique my interest to cook later. 

Downloading news to read at a later time.

2. Instagram
   
Watching and sharing reels.

Recording and editing stories using filters mostly for comedic effect. 

 Editing pictures intuitively. 

3. Moleskin Actions
   
Create lists.

Work in tandem with Moleskin's other apps such as Timepage to organize my schedule based on to-do lists created in Actions. 

I like how the animations and sound effects for crossing off items off lists are aesthetically pleasing so that I get an extra hit of dopamine when I do finish a task.

I would like to work on an App that keeps track of Puerto Rico's public transportation to inform the public on wait times. Most of the times the trains and buses are arrive either late or early with no way of knowing so I would like to alleviate this issue with an app. The app would feature latest wait time for the next train or buss to arrive. I would also like to include notifications for if there are any maintenance being performed on the traams that would affect such wait times and if/when a bus or a train is out of service. 

## Notes
Coming from C++ it was a natural process to understand the syntax of SwiftUI more or less but my biggest struggle was understanding how to manage the files and all the hidden functionalities of SwiftUI but also remembering to reconnect the actions with the UI elements.
